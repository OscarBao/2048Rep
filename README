        1. In vim, to find and replace every instance of the word
            fun with amazing, enter command mode and type ":%s/fun/amazing/g"
            In order to only replace the first instance in each line,
            enter the command mode and type ":%s/fun/amazing"

        2. In order to create a directory called fooDir with a directory
            called barDir inside it, type "mkdir fooDir fooDir/barDir"
        3. "javac *.java" compiles all .java extension files in a directory.
        4. In order to open all java files in a directory with one command

        5. In regards to methods, static means that the method can be accessed
            even without an object instanced in whatever class that method is
            in. For example, Math.random doesn't require an object of class 
            Math to be created.
    Java Questions
        6. Instead of having one single class for ShapeDrawer and methods
            representing each class type, instead, the student should
            have ShapeDrawer as a parent/superclass of certain classes.
            ShapeDrawer should have a draw() method as well as a color
            variable indicating that all ShapeDrawer subclasses should have 
            a draw() method, as well as a color setting. ShapeDrawer
            should have the subclasses Circle and Square, and both Circle
            and Square will implement their colors in the constructors and
            implement the drawing method. This will allow her to create
            any other type of square or circle, or even any other type
            of shape, easily, and, with the manipulation of inheritance, 
            inherit certain traits from the ShapeDrawer and Circle/Square
            parent classes without having to create one file with a huge
            chunk of redundant code.
